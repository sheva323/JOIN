## Day 1: Defining Project

We had a brainstorming session to choose our product and get a sneak peek at the technology stack and user flow.

**Decisions**: 
- **Product Selection:** We decided to focus on building a tool stack for DAOs, with a specific emphasis on developing a calendar for events. This choice aligns with our goal of providing valuable solutions to the DAO community.

- **Technology Stack Overview:** We conducted a brief overview of the technology stack that we plan to utilize for the project. This allowed us to understand the key components and frameworks necessary to implement the desired features. 

- **Minimal User Flow Definition:** During the initial stages, we defined the minimum user flow for our product. This involved mapping out the essential steps and interactions that users would go through while using the calendar for events within the DAO ecosystem. 


## Day 2: Tech approach

On the second day, we focused on delving deeper into the technologies and protocols we would be utilizing for our project. We made the following decisions:

**Decisions:**

- **Data Structure Sketch:** We started by creating a preliminary data structure to handle the required information within our tool stack.

- **Task Definition:** To ensure an organized and efficient development process, we defined specific tasks and assigned responsibilities to team members.

- **Initial Protocol Interaction Approach:** We examined the interactions between different protocols that would be involved in our project. This included considering how these protocols would communicate, share data, and collaborate to provide the desired functionalities.
